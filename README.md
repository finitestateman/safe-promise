# ts-safe

Safe is a TypeScript utility package that simplifies error handling for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It wraps your function calls or promises in a SafeResult object, ensuring that you always receive a consistent success or error response. With Safe, you can avoid repetitive try-catch blocks, streamline your error management, and make your code more robust and maintainable.
